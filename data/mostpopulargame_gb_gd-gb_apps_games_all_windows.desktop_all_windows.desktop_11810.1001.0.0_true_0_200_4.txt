They don't brake much either, so you need to plan your speed carefully.

Your kids can hand Tommy a skateboard to make him go faster as they become comfortable with blending the sounds.\r\n\r\n- With Skateboards and Helmets children practice reading as they are asked to fit Tommy's animal friends with skateboards and helmets.\r\n\r\n- In Turn the Blocks kids make words in a way that's fun by turning real-looking blocks with letters on each side until the word is spelled out.\r\n\r\n- Through Word Ball children learn to identify spoken words by helping Tommy bat the right ball.\r\n\r\n- With Word Magic kids learn about word families as they fill the corresponding pot with potion and watch magic happen\r\n\r\n- In Rocket Words children get to practice word families as they assemble and launch a rocket into space\r\n\r\nIf your children do not know the alphabet sounds yet, we recommend our Kids ABC Phonics app. And if your kids need to learn or practice the names of the letters, try our Kids ABC Letters app.\r\n\r\nEvery section is designed to let children enjoy success time after time and receive positive reinforcement from the likable teacher, so they want to keep learning. Once your child is involved and happy, you can relax, with the assurance that he or she is having a great time - and learning.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDLL6K","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Toca Builders","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53054.9007199266427002.74556771-9381-4dfe-bf47-44f29b07fad5.bba23432-17da-42f1-8c73-d50d64f54b9a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15775.9007199266427002.408852b6-a22f-4479-9d45-ed5ed089d83a.3ca5ddcf-0c34-4a04-b51c-d82902c5f827","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39538.9007199266427002.a54c560a-cf69-4d5c-82ef-7b1d1262e903.6b88c964-e45e-40a4-992e-9ee519acf302","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39558.9007199266427002.61738d8d-3b0b-49c7-b1ac-448fc4f720db.64fa0118-4ab8-4fba-8a4c-4ebaf50ba3f8","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11033.9007199266427002.d96864e7-f5e1-479f-9e08-ec0f62680a0c.0a0c60b4-15c2-4433-8a79-7527e4d59a01","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31991.9007199266427002.7f7c4575-8113-4c99-a089-6eb04f3106ac.504b3198-7b47-40b5-80d7-f8f33e40809c","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£2.49","Price":2.49,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"42","PackageFamilyNames":["TocaBocaAB.TocaBuilders_e8swm3qhs311t"],"ContentIds":["6ac5c055-c816-6067-0544-ed646d4cdeb0","0ed29340-9ff2-eb0b-33f5-e7a509df2363"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"If you can imagine it you can build it with the six Toca Builders!\r\n\r\nJoin your new builder friends on an island far away and create a whole new world with blocks.

The higher the level, the greater the reward\r\n- multilingual interface\r\n- original panoramic sound and music\r\n- additional DLC maps and campaigns with new enemies and towers\r\n- online worldwide leaderboards\r\n\r\nWe hope that Light Forces commanders, who loved the first part of Myth Defense, will be pleasantly surprised by the innovations in this part:\r\n• Enemies are now divided into classes: Live, Machine and Magic. Some towers affects only units of one class.\r\n• Moving platforms on the battlefield where you can build towers. Platform with a tower will move as close as possible to enemy units and attack them.\r\n• Some units (Dwarf and Paladin) wear armor. Armor absorbs 80% of low physical damage. Armor threshold is shown in the unit description which you can see by tapping on an enemy unit on the field. If tower causes more physical damage than the armor threshold, the armor breaks down and the unit gets full damage value. Armor doesn't protect units from other types of damage (fire , magic, etc)\r\n• Several fundamentally new towers:\r\n  - Fear Tower: scares enemy units, forcing them to run away from the tower for a while. One enemy can be scared only once (though some units are fearless).\r\n  - Cursed Tower: normally it shoots causing a base damage but can be charged with coins to temporarily multiply its power. If the health of the enemy unit does not exceed the base damage, the tower will kill it without spending extra-points. If the unit is strong tower will try to kill it, spending no more than enough extra-points.\r\n  - Jet Mace: shoots with a large spiked ball horizontally or vertically. It strikes several enemy units losing some destructive power each time. The ball continues to fly until it loses all the energy.\r\n  - Radioactive towers (Uranium and Plutonium): do not shoot, but continuously irradiates all units within damage radius. Golems and infected (by Plague or Poison Spider Tower) units are vulnerable to radiation.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ4WD","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Radiant Defense","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51309.9007199266245137.a99f9ee7-0ab9-435e-b392-854b8ff8c843.51671a62-6d46-41ff-9c39-21c508e3acf7","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61008.9007199266245137.725bfceb-80de-459b-ac8f-606943246785.5e5f8a71-a616-46eb-9364-483a4a632644","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"132","PackageFamilyNames":["Hexage.RadiantDefense_zwg7cyx1ds0cc"],"ContentIds":["3b7fc91b-48b5-778d-ca1f-0f01a632ef8c","74cbd9f8-ca63-c5bd-d70e-af4144e8c1a8","cd8804e2-58e2-796b-74ec-14afcec17c53"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"MILLIONS OF ALIENS WILL DIE\r\n\r\nRadiant Defense is a tower defense game set in a vibrant universe invaded by countless alien hordes.\r\n\r\nBuild your space fortress any way you wish, set up wide variety of weapons and traps and let the invasions begin!\r\n\r\nIN-APP PURCHASES\r\n\r\nRadiant Defense is free to play without any ads, supported only by in-app purchases.

Happy retro gaming!\r\n\r\nRocky Horror, The Fruit Machine can be played by touching the onscreen buttons (Or the corner game board icons, a real help for smaller screens) or by using a mouse-which covers most devices so happy retro gaming, all you need to provide is some real luck...\r\n\r\nTo add coins/credits to the fruit machine simply tap or click the red coin slot (Coin slot found at the top right of the fruit machine). Each tap/click of the coin slot will add four credits to the fruit machine, then just play the fruit machine like you normally would do. \r\n\r\nThe main features of Rocky Horror, The Fruit Machine include;\r\n\r\n-Trail Mystery Bonus Features-(When the trail is on number four you can select a random trail mystery bonus feature which may help you to either get a prize win or increase the trail number you are currently on, depending on the feature and most of the time they are a real help to the player. The mystery bonus features available include Random Rocket, Showskill, 3 Shot, Nudge, etc ...).\r\n\r\n-Trail Nudges, Nudge Gamble, Nudge Buster-(Trail nudges can be offered as a trail mystery bonus feature and are also offered randomly whilst playing the trail part of the fruit machine. When trail nudges are offered they are sometimes offered with a nudge gamble too and when you have trail nudges available you may use the nudge buster button to move all of the three main reels down one position at the cost of just one nudge, a real useful button indeed).\r\n\r\n-Hi-Lo Gamble-(When you get a prize win on the fruit machine or the trail number is nine or more, you will be offered an optional prize/trail hi-lo gamble. Here you can either collect your prize, gamble with a hi-lo or possibly exchange to the game board if available. If you gamble and lose, you will lose the gambled prize/trail, if you gamble and win though you will improve your prize/trail by one position/slot and if you have an exchange to game board offer, then that offer may improve too. If you are lucky and get to the top of the prize/trail board you will automatically win the trail jackpot repeater).\r\n\r\n-Exchange To Game Board-(When you get a prize win on the fruit machine or the trail number is nine or more, you may be offered an exchange to the game board. An exchange to the game board is offered when the tubes are lit in the tube slot next to the prize/trail amount you are currently on. When offered an exchange to game board amount, it will mirror the prize/trail slot you are currently on, the higher the slot, the better the game board exchange offer. The exchange offer may improve every time a hi-lo gamble is won, except on a trail jackpot repeater win).\r\n\r\n-Game Board/Tubes-(Once exchanged to the game board you can gamble and spin to try to add to or light up/activate the tubes or collect a tube if it’s active. The tubes consist of a cash tube, a grab tube, a nudge tube and a features tube which all offer different games and the higher the tube, the better. To select an active/lit up tube you can either press its corresponding button or press the corresponding corner icon on the game board. If any of the tubes reach the tube jackpot repeater slot you will automatically start the tube jackpot repeater game).\r\n\r\nThere are many more features like the board mystery bonus games, tile games, tube games/features, holds, trail holds, real fun and too many to list and explain in detail. The game also has retro sound effects, all in all, a lot of real retro fun in one retro fruit machine-happy retro

The ball eventually loses momentum and falls on to the wheel and into one of 37 (in French/European roulette) or 38 (in American roulette) colored and numbered pockets on the wheel.\r\n\r\nPlay with

When exchanged, the amount of nudges you start the game board with will be the same as the amount of crystals offered when exchanged to the game board, which you can use (Nudges) if you land on a Nudge Pot tile when playing the game board).\r\n\r\n-3-in-a-row-(Getting one number value on each of the three reels at the same time will automatically start the game board, automatically filling the words “Crystal Maze” and you will be awarded a random amount of nudges at the start of the game board which you can use if you land on a Nudge Pot tile when playing the game board).\r\n\r\n-Skill Stop reel feature-(Each letter of “Crystal Maze” lights up/goes out one by one and if stopped at the end of “Crystal Maze” it will start the game board where you’ll be awarded a random amount of nudges at the start of the game board which you can use if you land on a Nudge Pot tile when playing the game board).\r\n\r\n-Reel Skill reel feature-(The reels will step allowing you to stop them where you want, if you’re skilled or real lucky enough that is).\r\n\r\n-Nudge reel feature-(You will be awarded a random amount of nudges; each nudge can move a reel down by one step, so use the nudges wisely).\r\n\r\n-Boost reel feature-(It will add a random amount of letters to the words “Crystal Maze” and if you’re real lucky and the words get filled it will start the game board where you’ll be awarded a random amount of nudges at the start of the game board which you can use if you land on a Nudge Pot tile when playing the game board).\r\n\r\n-Stopper reel feature-(It will randomly flash one letter at a time in the words “Crystal Maze”, if you’re real lucky and stopped it on the last letter it will start the game board where you’ll be awarded a random amount of nudges at the start of the game board which you can use if you land on a Nudge Pot tile when playing the game board).\r\n\r\nThere are many more features like holds, trail held(s) and of course the game board game itself and its features too-which are too many to list and explain in detail but they are real fun and include Nudge Pots, Skill/Physical/Mystery challenges as well as Question Mark tiles with many options-and various games to be played along with the real BIG features like the Jackpot Repeater, Gold Series, Nudge Pot Repeater etc- for those lucky enough to be offered them.

New graphics! We will continue updating the game. Thank you for your support of independent game developers! \r\n\r\nUse your periscope to target and destroy enemy ships. Join our big submarine patrol team. Be on our submarine! \r\n\r\nLegend says: The year was 1982. Argentina invaded the Falklands and other British territories in the South Atlantic. The British sent an expeditionary force to retake the islands. \r\n\r\nIn Submarine Patrol, you will relive this era as a leader of a submarine that patrols the islands and destroys enemy battleships.   \r\n\r\nTarget well before you shoot! Remember, you have a limited number of torpedoes on board. You cannot immediately fire one torpedo after another. \r\n\r\nIt takes 2-3 seconds to prepare the next torpedo. Injured ships, depending on the amount of damage, may reduce their speed and move slower. \r\n\r\nDepending on the ship type, you can hit it 1 to 4 times before it is completely destroyed. You have 10 levels to complete. If you do well you will be promoted to commander, captain, or even an admiral. The quality of shooting is determined by your score. You score with every successful shot and you are fined with every missed torpedo.  \r\n\r\nPlease, check our website for tips and tricks on the game here: http://pepper-games.com","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NZGMFZVS0S3","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Ryza Roads","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58605.14481086349858484.c5617606-cb4b-4a85-aeb7-2b888d6bcad0.b107afe5-0da4-47a5-ac32-fd8d08d96c70","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2976.14481086349858484.c5617606-cb4b-4a85-aeb7-2b888d6bcad0.8fc392fe-2d23-4b32-80c0-dcb5fd0ea888","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48073.14481086349858484.c5617606-cb4b-4a85-aeb7-2b888d6bcad0.ca1f9ab0-08dd-46f5-9ca7-084aa94d7f70","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16200.14481086349858484.c5617606-cb4b-4a85-aeb7-2b888d6bcad0.f795be82-4f74-409f-8446-962303a939bf","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£1.29","Price":1.29,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["553FelipeFidelis.RyzaRoads_4ganz59kg4aby"],"ContentIds":["8bdbdf5e-0e5e-1c27-6218-5ebbe62082de","d39e04a4-ca3d-6042-c18e-f10552d15089"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Welcome to Ryza!\r\nIn this archipelago, you can explore, race, buy new vehicles, get achievements and more!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- 1km²+ map;\r\n- Many different vehicles;\r\n- Races against clock;\r\n- Races against CPU;\r\n- Vehicle customization;\r\n- Character customization;\r\n- Achievements;\r\n- Full keyboard/joystick support;\r\n- Much fun! :D\r\n\r\nTrailer music:\r\nSong: MBB -

To conquer as much territory as possible. It's initially very simple, and the game can be mastered immediately, but watch out: there's competition, and not everyone can win!\r\nWhether you're bold or more careful, you have to be more cunning than your adversaries by finding the best strategy to conquer the most space. But be careful! You have a weak spot: your tail. If an enemy touches it, that's the end for you.\r\nTry to stay ahead, because victory in Paper.io is never certain until you possess all the territory. Stealing is allowed, and your enemies won't hesitate to do so.\r\nAfter the success of Quiz Run, 1 Pic 8 Words, and Bool, Voodoo now offers you a new gaming and graphics experience inspired by io type games (made popular by agar.io). Enjoy the simplicity and strategy of an io game in a world with unique graphics.\r\nPaper.io is for the whole family and doesn't require an Internet connection.\r\n\r\nThis player will allow you to open your favorite web games inside a self-contained UWP app.  This allows better performance, privacy, and security.

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped. After taking these factors into account, there are approximately 1.75*1064 distinct games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N3NWHP1B18Z","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Archery World Tour","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51255.13999170889461654.1e968db3-baeb-4c39-aacb-fb0a03bc56a4.65fd65bd-d048-4270-aaa6-1814ff4bd61f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39762.13999170889461654.1e968db3-baeb-4c39-aacb-fb0a03bc56a4.e9dd945c-ed13-4d5a-88fa-7c3c0db59004","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["32631DigitalTechnologyCo.ArcheryWorldTour_hpptp5qsq5efw"],"ContentIds":["71ebf80f-8e5f-41df-d8bc-2e44955fc755","d3cb968c-5162-d575-f96c-c2706d92634a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Grab a bow and put your archery skills to the ultimate test!

Take control of a whole country, like the USA, Germany, France, Russia, or Austria. Change laws, taxes and budgets based on real world statistics and data, and see what happens.\r\n\r\nThe game simulates a whole country: Population, debt, GDP, economic growth, unemployment, crime, life expectancy, birth rate, mortality rate, state of the infrastructure and so on. The player can adjust budgets, taxes, laws, and see what the outcome is. \r\n\r\nReal World Data\r\n\r\nThe game is running on real-world data. Meaning everything is based on real values: If you play as the USA, the debt, income, expenditures, crime rate, unemployment rate, etc. you start with is based on the actual, real values of the USA. For example if you lower a tax rate, you'll see what the simulation calculates as new values afterwards, in dollars, people, crimes per 100.000, interest rate, life expectancy in years, and similar.\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\n\r\nThere are goals to fulfill, like decreasing the crime rate or achieving a certain public health or education rating, but it is already interesting to try to tamper with the various options alone: What happens if you lower the minimum wage? What if you change the length of maternity leave? Or the retirement age? You can also do more serious changes like introducing censorship laws, compulsory military service, cash bans, or universal basic income.\r\n\r\nThere are military options, so you can start a war with any country in the world, and adjust its operation mode while the conflict is active. But be sure not to let it run out of control. Some countries for example also have a nuclear option, of course.\r\n\r\nThe game also includes a media and public relations system, where you can read the most interesting headlines, and try to influence the media with PR stunts, interviews, and similar. \r\n\r\nCountries\r\n\r\nYou can play as the USA, Germany, Russia, France, and Austria: These are the countries the simulation was implemented and tested to work nicely. But there are also additional countries and scenarios which can be downloaded. It is also possible to create new countries and scenarios on your own and share them with others.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NSDCZ0M2BF6","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Myths of the World: The Heart of Desolation","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37363.14365128472410099.e9172223-f45c-43e0-9a00-eee7938793c1.17bf415b-387c-49a4-9059-8cd95fe2da93","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31434.14365128472410099.e9172223-f45c-43e0-9a00-eee7938793c1.0824a263-9156-463a-9754-5aa94eb0d635","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28624.14365128472410099.1a9a959a-98ab-4b7b-b8d1-f89b58ab1213.a0d41ded-1057-4e2d-b1d3-a6ff59a7fca0","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63805.14365128472410099.1a9a959a-98ab-4b7b-b8d1-f89b58ab1213.0e57bc7b-571c-4792-8719-a9353518d03d","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£8.39","Price":8.39,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["BigFishGames.MythsoftheWorldTheHeartofDesolation_bsrvrvej7yy2w"],"ContentIds":["cb2ee430-0701-bc95-e3ac-ed03918873b9"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Eipix continues its ground-breaking Myths of the World series with a heart-pounding, fire-breathing adventure!\r\n\r\nIt was just supposed to be a routine mission.

Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PBMHT7R51D3","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Asdivine Hearts","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18405.14120668810497520.4b884d5a-a668-426a-b619-42972dbfc947.54ba0935-7426-4347-9eec-bfab2fb86fb1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17550.14120668810497520.4b884d5a-a668-426a-b619-42972dbfc947.95ac9da1-c027-4c2c-bdfb-699fa4f6792e","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56628.14120668810497520.4b884d5a-a668-426a-b619-42972dbfc947.9803f420-359e-4041-8690-7ae6893509cf","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30816.14120668810497520.4b884d5a-a668-426a-b619-42972dbfc947.6938dd22-d3ba-4310-a48e-eeb335bc1231","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21569.14120668810497520.4b884d5a-a668-426a-b619-42972dbfc947.dcedb563-1185-43c4-918b-ea7e959d712f","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47660.14120668810497520.4b884d5a-a668-426a-b619-42972dbfc947.24b9d568-5898-4a3b-897f-c297b8ea5369","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£12.49","Price":12.49,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["KEMCO.AsdivineHearts_f2bp5vqmgh7cp"],"ContentIds":["09888760-7399-b55d-ad82-7afe03361a1d","68edfd91-e5df-498d-b6f6-afdc8b005921"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Travel alongside four companions and a cat in a fantasy RPG featuring stunning animated turn-based battles!\r\n\r\nOne year ago, the world of Asdivine was enveloped by a brilliant flash of light.

games are set in an 1880s-era casino using a 1980s-style interface. This isn't a shoot-em-up, just a laid-back, enjoyable way to learn how to play poker. Relax and have fun!\r\n\r\nAnnie, Cowboy, Gambler, and The Kid are four wisecracking card sharks who will try to take your money!\r\n\r\nEach player has his own unique style of play - and playing against those styles, combined with the Hints and context-based Strategy, should help you learn how to play poker. \r\n\r\nPlayers:\r\nAnnie: Annie is no stranger to these tables and she is much tougher than she looks. To her, poker is much more than a game, its how she makes her living. If you're not careful, she will take your money in a big hurry! She doesn't like to lose so she'll fold on a weak hand but bet hard on a strong one.\r\n\r\nCowboy: The Cowboy is a tough one to figure out. Maybe he's had a tough day and is distracted. Maybe he's just not very good at poker. Sometimes he'll fold on a good hand and bluff a bad one. However, if he has a really good hand, he'll usually bet.\r\n\r\nKid: The Kid is in town looking for a good time. He has money to burn and has been in the Casino a bit too long. His loose and passive play can be irritating. He'll make a mistake or two but be careful, he can fool you into losing your money!\r\n\r\nGambler: The Gambler is a bona fide \"shark\" and knows the odds. He is here for one reason only - to take your money! He plays tight and aggressive which means he'll usually bet on a hand he thinks can win. If he doesn't think he'll win a hand, he'll fold so be careful when he decides to bet. He'll bluff every now and then, just to keep you on your toes.\r\n\r\nLearn to Play:\r\nYou have many options for hints and strategy. Hints are displayed to help you decide whether to Bet, Raise, Call, or Fold. The Strategy Mode gives you more information about your hand and your odds of improving. You also have the option of seeing your opponents’ cards during the deal! \r\n\r\nIf you find a bug or enjoy the program, please let us know!

The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called \"the Turtle\". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans. \r\nAs any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package. \r\nA tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play. The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles. The game is finished when either the layout is empty, or there are no exposed pairs remaining.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH522V2","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Bus Tycoon ND","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46290.13510798887643793.0811cf34-1a18-4b8c-9be0-d18ad8612202.53095517-62da-47bb-bc63-d35ca09ff2ab","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14248.13510798887643793.8a0f572e-a037-4ae5-a823-d4cac26a6096.fa686a4b-7e56-4a71-ba16-a6e92ce1b6ea","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38744.13510798887643793.9a4fd7f5-8143-465c-9769-22cde0ed991f.441e4c65-3041-4855-92d4-51edf1110cec","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39804.13510798887643793.ca67097c-c156-4380-98ec-42fb77ff3a36.385d5d19-df0e-4376-bfb4-0eff2996e829","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"StrikethroughPrice":"£8.39","DisplayPrice":"£2.09","Price":2.09,"AverageRating":1.5,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["DAAA4040.BusTycoonND_fwykrzx4xsh64"],"ContentIds":["ea83d546-7d6d-ed35-a213-352605c80349","1739ca57-7a0b-5e34-7f76-aed8b2470220","9ef4b809-423d-03e1-393f-8fceb99cd0d1"],"Badges":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V3.ProductBadge, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","StyleKey":"Default","Text":"Caomhain £6.30","Type":"Merchandized"}],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Start building your passenger transport empire between cities all night and day!\r\n\r\nBus Tycoon ND (Night and Day) is a passenger transport tycoon game. Start building your transport empire by creating bus routes between as many cites as possible. You can freely build the road network and create traffic lights in order to have a better control of your traffic. \r\n\r\nThe player's company is responsible for connecting service centers to  gas stations and connecting these to other cities. This will facilitate the transportation of passengers on the buses, as the buses require fuel and servicing. Purchase a variety of bus models, based on their fuel type and consumption. Update your gas station's fuel supply to unlock newer bus models. Each bus route can accommodate a maximum of eight connections. You can build up to 30 bus stations and vehicles per game. At any time, you can upgrade your bus stations, in order to accommodate more passengers. Moreover, you can sell used vehicles to buy new and even more advanced ones.\r\n \r\nYour vehicles fuel up automatically if a road connection is available to the central gas station. But, at some point your vehicles will have to be serviced. You will have to send them to a service center (go to service), otherwise breakdowns will occur more frequently, eventually resulting in the loss of your vehicle. Road cracks also appear sometimes causing damage to your buses, so keep your roads maintained and clear of cracks. \r\n\r\nKey game features: \r\n- transport passengers between bus stations \r\n- a variety of bus models \r\n- upgrade stations to large bus hubs\r\n- upgrade gas station to offer different fuel types \r\n- beautiful night and day graphics, automatic or manual settings\r\n- build road network freely \r\n- build traffic lights to each junction\r\n- automatic breakdown generation\r\n- automatic road crack generation\r\n- various demolishing tools\r\n\r\nThe developer's notes:\r\nIf you liked the game, please provide us with feedback or a review and rate the game.

The house is just fine but Joan considers that she needs to renovate the guest house before her sister comes. That way her sister will feel more comfortable to stay there longer.\r\n\r\nJoan will need our help because renovating the house includes a lot of responsibilities. There are a lot of objects that have to be taken away from the house before the actual renovation starts.

If we make something bad to someone, after a certain period of time that act will possibly have an effect on us or on someone close to us. Many people believe in this even though it is not accepted as general truth…but let's start from the beginning.\r\n\r\nCheryl is an expert in paranormal activities. Nicole has called her because she was simply terrified by something that happened in her house, actually by the condition of her house. Nicole accidently has found out that her grandfather many years ago has hidden somewhere in the house golden coins with a great value. The other part of the story is that those coins are cursed and every person that will try to take those coins will have a huge accident.

This was the first return, in earnest, of the Western Allied powers to the continent of Europe since the disastrous withdrawal of the BEF from France in 1940.\r\n\r\nTwo armies were involved: The US 7th Army, commanded by Patton, and the British 8th Army, commanded by Montgomery. They faced a variety of Axis formations, from demoralised Italian coastal defences to tougher German mechanised troops, remnants of the Afrika Corps and Italian elites.\r\n\r\nThis game allows you to play either the Allied invasion, or the Axis defenders. The aim of the Allies is to capture the 3 principle cities of Sicily (Catania, Palermo and Messina) as quickly as possible. The Axis must prevent this.\r\n\r\nYou can either play another person hot-seat, or either side against your device.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 options you can set:\r\nAllied reinforcements: Fewer than historical, or more reinforcements from the historical floating reserves.\r\nAxis reinforcements: Fewer than historical, or more German and Italian reinforcements could be sent.\r\nLanding site: The historical site chosen was not the original one - there was an alternative Western site.\r\n\r\nIn all, there are 147 selectable combinations, plus you can set any of the options to a random choice for a more exciting, unpredictable game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDF5M9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"FlipPix Art - Sports","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61199.9007199266282728.1d2da914-f0af-4e89-a0c9-5ea8098fa38c.d41bf34f-3efe-4d08-a143-62a8e80424cd","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57102.9007199266282728.48418a10-c541-4ead-9805-9c179a2ea04a.0ffe6641-2101-42aa-a786-0b8011b5e366","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£1.69","Price":1.69,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["GabySoft.FlipPixArt-Sports_zx92rj14ktb0g"],"ContentIds":["86ab6dda-6a38-3ba3-3f2f-00cb2aa0dbe3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Everyone has their favorite sport - to watch or play.
