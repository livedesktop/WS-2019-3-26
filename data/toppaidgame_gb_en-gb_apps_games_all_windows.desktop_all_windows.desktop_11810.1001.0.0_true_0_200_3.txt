After your child uses Friendly Maths a few times, the app will start choosing questions that gently challenge your child's ability without discouraging progress. The goal is to achieve that sweet spot where questions are not too easy and not too difficult to achieve maximum benefits.  \r\n \r\nMy motivation for developing Friendly Maths grew out of watching my two children interact with various Maths apps over the years. I noticed that some apps were too harsh on the kids, using negative scoring which resulted in a lot of tears and frustration. Other apps were timed games offering multiple choice answers. My concern with those was that kids learned to quickly press the correct buttons without much understanding of the subject matter.\r\n\r\nFriendly Maths was developed to address some of these concerns. With Friendly Maths, children are not timed in order to allow them time to think, consolidate knowledge, and truly understand problems. Incorrect answers are not penalized and the app often offers second chances. I believe that this approach encourages the spirit of learning and experimentation. Positive reinforcement is used, not negative scoring. This prevents children from forming negative attitudes towards Maths and protects their self-esteem. The apps' simple visual design helps children focus on Maths with minimal distractions, so that learning can easily be transferred into school testing and real life scenarios. \r\n \r\nFriendly Maths provides your child with rewards in the form of collectible achievements. For best effect, parents are encouraged to provide additional positive reinforcement by linking app achievements with additional rewards. You know best what works for your child, whether it is extra pocket money, screen time, taking them on a trip or nothing at all.  Each achievement is unlocked by answering 100 questions correctly, which can be done in a session or two. Ideally, your child should be encouraged to use the app a few times a week, so 3 or 4 achievements a week should be optimal. Again, a balance should be achieved here.  Too little use may not provide optimal benefits, but too much use may result in negative attitudes and fatigue. Again, you know best what is optimal for your child. \r\n \r\nFriendly Maths can be used by up to five children providing they are sharing a computer. It is important that every child is playing under his or her \"login\" as the app tailors questions to your child. If they have dedicated devices, you will need a separate license for each child.  \r\n \r\nFriendly Maths lets you install the app on multiple devices and the progress will follow your child as she changes devices. So, your child can start on one device and continue playing on another.  \r\n \r\nI have done my best to design Friendly Maths for special accessibility requirements, but I have limited resources for testing this. If you find something is not working optimally in terms of accessibility, please email me so that I can improve it. I am really keen to get this right!\r\n \r\nIf you encounter any bugs or problems, just drop me an email. I can usually fix issues quickly. No call centers here, I will personally reply to your emails.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

It is believed that this two-player board game originated as a popular form of recreation with both royalty and peasantry. But by the mid-13th century BC, Senet had evolved into a more religious ritual. Some depictions from this time period forward show the game being played not by two people, but rather as a deceased player competing against an invisible adversary, interpreted by some to symbolize the deceased players own soul.\r\n\r\nThe board has become a metaphor for the afterlife with pawns moving across the board just as a soul moves through layers of the netherworld after death. Reaching the final space and leaving the board is the goal of the game, just as reaching Horus and leaving the netherworld was the goal for the Egyptians after their death for attaining rebirth with the gods Isis & Osiris, Sekhmet & Bastet holding the Egyptian Ankh or the papyrus scepter.\r\n\r\nThe game board consists of 30 squares or slots, arranged in 3 horizontal rows of 10. Pawns move from left to right through row 1, then drop down and move from right to left through row 2. Dropping down again, pawns move from left to right along row 3 and finally, off the board. The game uses the rules developed by Timothy Kendall in his 1978 work, Passing Through the Netherworld :The Meaning and Play of Senet, an Ancient Egyptian Funerary Game.\r\n\r\nThe game includes five special squares, governed by their own rules, each containing a hieroglyphic. Square 15 is the House of Rebirth; square 26 is the House of Beauty; square 27 is the House of Water: square 28 is the House of the Three Truths; square 29 is the House of Two Truths; and square 30, the last, is the House of Horus, the Egyptian falcon-god and lord of the sky.\r\n\r\nEgyptian Senet is a pharaonic challenging game that combines luck,strategy,and magic features authentic photos of ancient Egyptian temples,plus artistically crafted graphics and animation of an ancient stone game board and pieces,set in an echoing,tomb-like chamber.Ritualistic music plus sound effects of stone pieces moving recreate the atmosphere of predynastic Egypt.The App's Icon shows the Egyptian Queen Nefertari playing Senet in her tomb,she was the great wife of the pharaoh Ramesses II(Ramses)Rio. Also many Egyptian Queens have a similar photos playing Senet such as Cleopatra,Nefertiti the great royal wife of Akhenaten,and the Queen Hatshepsut the wife of Thutmose II.\r\n\r\nSupported Languages in year 2016 - 2017 - 2018 - 2019 : (English, Arabic, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Dutch, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Portuguese-Brazil)\r\nSuitable for everyone Adults and Kids.\r\nPerfect relaxing and time killer (timekiller) game with good prices for all countries.\r\nHighly Recommended for anyone interested in Egyptology, Archeology, Sphinx, Mythology, Archaic, Arcane, Agony, Edu, Monopoly, Atypical, Indiana Jones, Nancy Drew, Compulsive,Tic Tac Toe, Very Positive, Overwhelmingly Positive,Outstanding, Uncommon and Unusual Games.\r\n\r\nFor More Info (Information):\r\nSupport Email: ezzatstudios@gmail.com\r\nFacebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/EgyptianSenet ","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NW8VRCCLRZ4","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Bulldozer!","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57295.14449495464595361.3740fb17-d6cf-4018-a9fa-764412d47ee4.bdc4e6e3-c53b-40e4-b519-d8f3825639ba","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#6C5CD6","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6256.14449495464595361.2fe09d35-6b2b-4538-9c65-4af02c36fd4d.e94294be-5de6-44e5-9360-30ee973d6842","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#6C5CD6","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54880.14449495464595361.1cb6b5c0-b89d-4cad-8d08-833476ea4a81.da76fc3a-484f-4c4d-9bd8-380a540aacbb","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#6C5CD6","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42329.14449495464595361.0fdd3fb9-43a7-4c14-a05d-61cb96ce0f8d.74de76ed-12a5-41e0-8b32-e9a33a694beb","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£0.79","Price":0.79,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["TheCodeZone.Bulldozer_nv9a13k0a31r2"],"ContentIds":["349f2def-11a0-732b-2ccc-d59178d8fb59"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The classic \"Push the boulders\" game from the 1990's is now available for Windows 10 and in a brand-new edition!

Their first book of fairytales that was published back in 1812 included about 200 fairy tales making those brothers one of the most famous storytellers of folk tales, which made stories like 'Cinderella', 'The Frog Prince', 'Hansel and Gretel', 'Rapunzel', Sleeping Beauty' and 'Snow White' to be well-known all around the world. Even though it is known that those tales are collected, there are numerous discussions about the ideology behind those tales sometimes being criticized for the certain note of violence and crudity that appears in some of the stories while others debate about the possibility of including real situations when the brothers were editing those stories.\r\n\r\nDoris and Ralph are philologists that work in one of the most interesting clubs in the world. They have job as many of us would dream of. Namely this time they got a task to discover if the brothers Grimm's fairytales are based on true stories or they are simply part of someone's fantasy, no matter if brothers Grimm's or the fantasy of the folk storyteller, taken in general.\r\n\r\nDoris and Ralph are at the moment in the land where they hope that was the land where actually happened the story about Snow White and the seven dwarfs.

Harry at the End of the World is a traditional point-and-click adventure game, in the vain of Samorost and Machinarium, where solving puzzles comes with a sense of discovery and accomplishment. This gameplay style, merged with unique artstyle inspired by 15th century engravings, creates the perfect backdrop for a story about heartbreak, redemption and, quite literally, the end of the world.\r\n\r\nIn Apocalipsis you play as Harry, for whom the loss of his beloved was the end of his world. Now he has to venture out into the strange, unwelcoming lands to get her back. On his journey he will meet fantastical creatures, straight from the minds of artists from the 15th century Europe, and ultimately conquer his own, personal demons. \r\nFeaturing the narration by Nergal, leader of the band Behemoth, with the added atmospheric new rendition of Behemoth's music, it will be a journey to remember.\r\n\r\nApocalipsis shares with the Middle Ages its artstyle and the game’s world itself is inspired by Book of Revelation and steeped in medieval philosophy and beliefs, with the story taking cues from Dante Alighieri’s “Divine Comedy”.\r\nEvery location and character in Apocalipsis was inspired by classical woodcuts by 15th and 16th century artists such as Hans Holbein, Michael Wolgemut, and Albrecht Dürer. This pairing of medieval art and philosophy with video games creates something unique, like you’ve never seen before.\r\n\r\nCome, let us take you on a journey you will not

Dogs are the most devoted friends. You can teach your cute puppy different commands. You can play ball, travel, and just take care of it. Dogs also have a great nose and are the best detectives! In exchange for their service, each dog dreams about a tasty bone! In this coloring book, you will find exciting scenes from the life of dogs of various breeds.\n\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MWN64Q712VD","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Wenjia Complete Edition","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10678.13840589489345583.9cbcdb83-298e-4af5-8dd1-725050aca170.97f7c5b6-6e20-44e3-9e0d-554a9ee07c08","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6134.13840589489345583.9cbcdb83-298e-4af5-8dd1-725050aca170.826180e1-72ad-4482-841c-f993ed2d0187","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34504.13840589489345583.9cbcdb83-298e-4af5-8dd1-725050aca170.bba4d684-20a9-499a-906a-519c035995e7","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£8.39⁺","Price":8.39,"AverageRating":3.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":[""],"ContentIds":[],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Wenjia Complete Edition includes everything we want to deliver to our beloved users, get it now and enjoy the journey!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MXQ6RHWHZQZ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Балда®","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1745.13885654498801754.b10cd778-5fdb-4068-968b-6fe1cdb3e75c.4c094f21-9c1e-4ca4-ad57-741ff2bf394a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9843.13885654498801754.63e34abd-d59d-4a10-95fa-1ce09ad41572.33b855b1-f8ca-4e78-b44b-d3e98d1bcbe2","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46336.13885654498801754.7704c004-aee5-4162-8c09-5e1b50db8125.c6c3ece5-83e2-43ba-85b1-d3d24f8a6bde","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£0.99","Price":0.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["3700Valentines.508612BBE76E1_qv6834jn39ppr"],"ContentIds":["5759e103-52ac-d905-7251-111c4f688982","ab9f5592-0df7-ced6-16e2-7f2bc460f708"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Balda and full online access.\r\nPlay on the Internet without registration and for free.\r\nFeatures:\r\n● Playing with everyone on the Internet without registration and for free.\r\n● Play together on one device.\r\n● Play against the device.\r\n● Intuitive management.\r\n● Fields from 2х2 to 9х9.\r\n● Play on time (the ability to choose a time from 30 seconds to 5 minutes).\r\n● Ability to turn off time.\r\n● The robot player adapts to your playing style.\r\n● Constantly updated dictionary.\r\n● Play with the robot while waiting for your opponent online\r\n● Send messages\r\n\r\nRules:\r\nIn the middle of the field the word is selected.\r\nYou compose a word consisting of letters already on the field and necessarily one new letter that you add.\r\nThe longer the word you come up with, the more points you get.\r\nOne letter is one point.\r\nThen the opponent goes, adding a new letter, and so on in turn.\r\nWords in one game can not be repeated.\r\nThe word is composed of letters that are sequentially in any direction from cell to cell up, down, left or right.\r\nYou can use only nouns in their main form, that is, in the singular and nominative.\r\nWords that exist only in the plural -

for your child. That’s why we have developed Multiplication Dragons, to provide new, fun ways to engage with multiplication that stimulate ease of memorization and improved recall. We all know how difficult it is to remember things without using the proper tools, and Multiplication Dragons provides just that. Our brightly colored, unique, three-dimensional environments provide visual and auditory spaces in which children can learn by associating multiplication questions with a rhyme, an in-game location, and the dragon that asks the question.\r\n\r\nMultiplication Dragons helps increase memorization and ease of recall using two memory devices that reinforce each other: rhyme and the memory palace (a.k.a. the method of loci). It will introduce your child to the world of multiplication using 3D animated dragons that guide them through 12 different environments, including a lagoon, a Halloween inspired level, a mountain, caves, a winter setting, and more! Each of the 144 questions is asked by one of our many dragons, stationed in various locations and levels throughout the game. Questions are asked using a phrase that both rhymes with the answer, and relates to the particular surroundings of the level currently being played. Multiplication questions also appear onscreen and are read aloud, a design feature used to help young readers and those experiencing difficulty reading, and to provide our dragons with a bit of extra personality. \r\n\r\nWe draw on rhyme because it has been used in various ways and has stood the test of time as a mnemonic device. After all, how many times has the age-old “thirty days has September, April, June, and November” rhyme helped you to recall the number of days in a month? It has been used for generations, and proven its success over and over again. Our second memory device, the memory palace, is one of the oldest and most successful tools in the book! This method goes back to the ancient Greeks, and involves imagining a familiar environment (like your home) and associating the things to be remembered with particular areas or aspects of that environment.  The visual and spatial qualities of this form provide additional contact points that aid in the creation of cognitive associations with the thing that we want to remember. This creates more access routes for our brains to get at the desired information, and thus increases ease of recall. By using both of these methods together we have increased these possible cognitive associations even further, while providing you and your child with hours of fun!\r\n\r\nChildren will earn 1-3 stars based on the amount of correct answers given on a level, giving them the opportunity to return to a level and break their current score. They will also get an encouraging cheer from our dragons for each right or wrong answer, and unlock new levels by successfully completing a timetable level. They can also make use of an added visual cue by reviewing the timetable itself, and test recall by attempting quiz mode. Here, your child must answer questions without the rhymes, and in random order, simulating a school math test. And unlike other games that offer one free level and then charge you for the remaining eleven, we ask for one payment which includes access to all twelve levels, quiz mode, and timetable mode.\r\n\r\nMultiplication Dragons provides your child with a whole world of exploration that introduces, reinforces, and tests multiplication skills, in a mode that feels like play.

The game is played with a standard deck of cards (including 2 jokers). \r\n\r\nPlayers are dealt a total of 12 cards.  The remaining 6 cards are dealt face down into the 'Kitty'.  Each player will bid starting clockwise from the dealer (dealer bids last).  \r\nThe bid consists of a bid number and description.  The bid number is the number of tricks (books) a player believes his partnership can achieve over 6. For example, a bid of 4 = 10 books. \r\n\r\nThe bid description indicates a bid direction (High or Low) or whether the bid is a 'No' trump. A bid direction of High (Uptown) indicates A,K,Q... are the highest value cards. A bid direction of Low (Downtown, Special) indicates A,2,3... are the highest value cards. A 'No' trump bid indicates that each suit has equal weight and the lead card can not be 'cut'.  The bid direction of a 'No' bid is specified after winning the bid.\r\nBid numbers can range from 3 - 7.  The Option screen gives the player the option of playing with a minimum of 3 or 4.\r\nBid descriptions have the following weights:  'No' > 'Low' > 'High'.  The Option screen allows the player to play make 'Low' and 'High' equal in weight: 'No' > 'Low' = 'High'. \r\n\r\nThe highest bidder indicates a 'trump' suit or in the case of a 'No' bid indicates the direction (High/Low).  The jokers become the highest value cards in the indicated 'trump' suit.  For example, if Diamonds were called as 'trump' the highest value cards for a 'High' direction would be:  Big Joker, Little Joker, A, K,...  In the case of a 'No' bid, the Big Joker and Little Joker have no value and should be discarded as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe bid winner will start play as the lead player.  The remaining players must play a card in the same suit as the lead card if available. If the player does not have a card in that suit they may play another suit. The highest value card in the lead suit wins the sequence unless a trump card is played in which case the highest trump card wins the sequence. The winner of the sequence will be the lead player in the following sequence. \r\n\r\nGame Options\r\n\r\nPractice Mode:  The computer will not bid.  Allowing the player to always win bid and practice different plays.\r\nScoring - Conventional and Progressive:  With Conventional scoring the bid winner may go into negatives if the bid is not acheived.  Progressive scoring will award points to the opposition team if the bid is not achieved.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4VP6K","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"City Play Desktop","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28120.13510798887506638.6181fc5c-5be0-4050-87fa-26bf4efb8ca6.7a201508-3aad-41d3-88f0-e6c3afab7b76","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28231.13510798887506638.4fd8c9f3-5635-41ff-9120-b6dbf67b0d6f.64eb56c9-6bfb-46e0-98fc-b5531da252c3","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39131.13510798887506638.0032ee44-3a72-48b6-9e77-34051a1e0c1d.31b80f7b-ae7b-4227-9e85-3b6b40024171","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49432.13510798887506638.3b9e715c-bc83-4cbd-92d8-0b45682ab556.e9946d43-5108-40af-ba9a-c6759a788949","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"StrikethroughPrice":"£11.74","DisplayPrice":"£2.93","Price":2.93,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["DAAA4040.CityPlayDesktop_fwykrzx4xsh64"],"ContentIds":["c9a30428-b83a-2147-3a3a-56837a840041"],"Badges":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V3.ProductBadge, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","StyleKey":"Default","Text":"SAVE £8.81","Type":"Merchandized"}],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"CityPlay is an indie developed city builder simulation-strategy game.

It's also a great way for grownups to clear one's mind, or get into that trance or meditative state when thoughts can ramble around as they want.  \r\nYou can play Wall Ball in standard mode, with a pretty fast ball, or in easy mode with a rather large and slower moving ball, or you can even play in seated mode, suitable for people with some physical impairment or if you just feel very tired.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL STUFF:\r\nBefore starting the game, Make sure you have the Kinect camera (sensor) properly installed on your computer. Follow instructions from Microsoft website to install Kinect and the necessary SDK software  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561 \r\nTo use Kinect for Xbox One on your computer, you need the Kinect Adapter for Windows. After installation of the Kinect software you should be able to see the Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0 in your app menu. \r\nFind a good spot to play where the Kinect camera can view you from head to feet. You can easily check this with the software that follows with the installation of the Kinect SDK software. You can for instance run Kinect Studio v2.0 (under Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0) to view yourself in front of the Kinect.\r\nIf everything looks ok, then you can start the Wall Ball game.\r\nIt can be recommended to connect your computer to a larger monitor or TV screen (using a HDMI cable) to  improve the \"feel\" of the game and making it easier to see.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:\r\n•\tFree the space around you to not hurt yourself or to break any furniture. (Think about arms could be waving upwards too.)\r\n•\tIf children are playing they should be supervised and instructed by parents to not hurt themselves bumping into furniture.\r\n•\tIf other people are present in the room, make sure they are not in front of the camera and that they are at a safe distance from you bumping in to them.\r\n•\tIf you experience problem with balance, consider sitting down when playing.\r\n\r\nQUICK START\r\nBefore you start, make sure Kinect is properly installed and you have tested a good spot for playing where the Kinect sensor can \"read\" you properly, see above under \"Technical stuff\". If you have two graphic cards on your system, run the game with the better card otherwise it can affect Kinect/game performance. (For example, if you have a nvidia card you can manage this in nvidia control panel, manage 3D settings.)\r\nStart the game by pressing the Wall Ball icon.\r\nFrom the Main Menu (start screen), choose one of the three game variants Standard or Easy version or if you would like to sit down and play, choose Seated mode. The ball is somewhat larger and slower in Easy and Seated mode.\r\nWith the Toggle Show Settings (down at the right corner), you can adjust for your camera's placement above the floor. It is recommended to fine tune this. If the camera height setting are too low, you will feel like your feet are really heavy and won't lift properly. If it's to high, your feet will float in the air. The camera height slider correspond to the Kinect sensor's placement above the floor, however if it is tilted, you may have to adjust the slider more.\r\nStand in front of the Kinect camera, let the camera know you're there by moving slightly. When camera has found you, start kicking.\r\nKick the ball by using your right or left foot. When aiming, remember this is virtual reality so aim in a real world scale, not just in a small tv screen scale, that is, play like you were in the park yourself facing a large wall about 4 meters in front of you.\r\nIf the ball touches the area right behind you (an area as wide as the yellow area you're standing on) you will lose one ball. \r\nTo prevent the ball from hitting this area, you can stop the ball with your \"body\", shown as a silhouette, or just use your feet. You can slide from side to side inside the yellow area and crunch (you can't really move forward or backward, only as far as your legs can reach).\r\n\r\nIf you have lost all of your five balls, the game will end and you can choose to save, restart or exit. You choose between alternatives by putting your foot in one of the boxes, in this way you can restart instantly if you would like without the need to reach for the computer. You can also click on the signs with the mouse. From the Start screen, you can click on Result Menu where you can view your results.\r\n\r\nVideo tutorial: https://youtu.be/qFTv-q2cccg\r\nPDF tutorial: http://www.mixxusstudio.com/game-production/kinect-games\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5X430","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Mahjong Solitaire**","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17489.13510798886383389.3ed37184-afab-4fe7-8880-a1fa9fa71dd4.610c2fcf-3177-44f5-b7d4-c8b39fed778e","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#ff0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29108.13510798886383389.674c7705-d88c-4546-b174-1e1078b993ee.d010beab-fdee-49af-bd30-d49e392892d7","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#ff0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£1.69","Price":1.69,"AverageRating":4.3,"RatingsCount":"17","PackageFamilyNames":["41169ZTLLC.Mahjong_xzsreqmkr4cme"],"ContentIds":["51d917ec-79d7-d186-0a1d-daaf650d03c6"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The game goal is to clear the board by removing all the matching identical pairs from the layout.  \r\n\r\nMatch Rule: \r\n- Two identical tiles can me removed. \r\n- All of the seasons and flowers can be matched with each others, they don't have to be identical.  \r\n\r\nEach tile of the pair must comply with the following rules : \r\n- No other tile is lying above or is partially covering it \r\n- No other tile is lying to the left or to the right of it  \r\n\r\nWith many features: \r\n- great graphics \r\n- lots of levels \r\n- lots of background \r\n- lots of layouts \r\n- unlimited hints \r\n- unlimited Undos","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH6CP3G","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Letter Sounds Song and Game™","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14240.13510798886618115.c6466d69-fe7b-4ec1-b2d1-876fdf1bd77f.921b39d1-5700-4286-aea4-daa7bdc0091a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2932.13510798886618115.cf5ab728-1eda-4426-801d-a73134e69e58.9319e599-5b38-4d83-9adb-a12aa18e94ab","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£1.69","Price":1.69,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["E5CEBA72.LetterSoundsSongandGame_sek193xj0qzgc"],"ContentIds":["bb6fafb7-c8a1-df24-b80b-390f0beed5b7"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Learn Beginning Phonics with Letter Sounds Song and Game™ - The fast, fun, and effective way to learn phonics! \r\n\r\nThis software uses our popular Letter Sounds Song™ to teach students letter sounds.

types of businesses: Cars, rockets, phones, tanks, trucks, airplanes, computers, and ships. Design, produce, market and sell them. You can even run multiple companies at the same time.\r\n\r\nStart by creating a company: First, choose what to produce. For example, you can design cars (combustion engine based, electric, hybrid), then produce, market and sell them. Other types of products are trucks, phones, computers, ships, airplanes, tanks and even rockets. Once you are successful, you can even start more companies, and run them at the same time.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet market demands, you need to design your products so that customers will actually want them, and won't prefer to buy your competitors products. Research new technologies and design new products as your move on to fit into a moving market. For example for cars, you want to research bigger and more efficient batteries, if you decide to produce electric cars, or more performant combustion engines if you want to produce gasoline or diesel based cars.\r\n\r\nThe game is running in real-time, but can be accelerated and paused at any time. Manage employees, track financial and sales data, start and run marketing campaigns, analyze the market. Expand your company when you have figured out how everything works and manage the production plan and build new facilities, warehouses, offices or even launch pads.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

Moreover, once you manage to reach the bottom level of the dungeon and slay Lord Slyn, you'll also have to fight your way and survive the road back to the surface.\r\n\r\nMultiple player classes with awesome abilities\r\n\r\nBefore starting your quest you will have to choose one of the five possible hero classes: fighter, mage, paladin, priest, and ranger.\r\n\r\nEach of these classes come with unique strengths and weaknesses that will require a different approach when confronting the enemies from the dungeon.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as most rogulike games, death is final so advance carefully and engage in battles only when you're sure you can come out victorious or you'll have to start the adventure from the very beginning.\r\n\r\nBesides monsters, the dungeon is also the place where you will find lots of weapons, equipment and consumables with different properties. While some can give you an instant boost to your skills, other can be cursed and besides their negative effects will bind to your hero needing you to remove their curse if you want to get rid of them.\r\n\r\nSpell books, potions, and magic wands can also be found during your adventure but, will require identification scrolls if you don't want to risk casting a curse on yourself or drinking a deadly potion.\r\n\r\nThe game packs lots of content regarding weapons, equipment, and other consumables which combined with the random dungeon generator, makes it deliver a completely unique experience each time you play it.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDS369","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Virtual Anime Girl","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53578.9007199266577486.e22b8fbf-23e9-4d1a-bd80-944593788167.e6a8b781-5cf5-4bc4-a5cd-4af5222a63f4","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3297.9007199266577486.9cf496ab-cb60-4295-8ec2-1e822fb92772.e7954dd6-9930-4af6-aeca-c4a434141ed5","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£1.29","Price":1.29,"AverageRating":2.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["GlutenFreeGames.VirtualAnimeGirl_f7c4a2qk8qxct"],"ContentIds":["f076e5b1-2a58-840b-2737-02c2d33c5b4e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Design and dress up your very own Virtual Anime Girl!

In many cases those feelings lead some imponderable and immature persons to commit bad acts, even criminal acts and in particular extremes, murders...

According to the obvious evidences, Mike fell from the window of the third floor, but we have to admit that this has happen under suspicious conditions. Searching for some clues that could explain the situation more clearly, detective Harry found out that Mike's professor Nick was jealous of the bachelor thesis that the young student made, and didn't want Mike to become famous for his discovery.\r\n\r\nFor some people this is nothing to be worry about, professors usually accept that their students are better than they are and they are happy about their success but it seems that there are some that are afraid that someone else's academic successes could put a shadow to their work... If those suspicions are true, this would be a terrible discovery and something that will threaten the whole University, but traces lead to that terrible discovery...","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N6QGTV67N15","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"FSXFollow","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22971.14009213795012220.a201d190-08d9-407e-bdb7-ff26394c661d.7ef103b8-7d16-4bc9-9a79-afa30a1a9430","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#00b2f0","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£0.79","Price":0.79,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["41666PositionGamesINCOMPL.FSXFollow_zqkpvgs66mf28"],"ContentIds":["ec24542d-63a4-4f28-2099-6300bdb330c2","1796eab5-c570-1734-ffc4-07e45cff9949"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Do you own Microsoft Flight Simulator.

Similar to shuffleboard, the game is played on a flat ice curling sheet, roughly 15x150 feet. Players slide round stones of about 40 pounds towards bull's eye targets at either end. Two teammates may use brooms to sweep the ice in front of the moving stone. Curling3D is a follow-up to MaxNick's successful iCurling game, and adds a new dimension of realism with 3D rendering and on-screen players. Many user suggestions have been integrated into this new curling simulation.\r\n\r\nCurling3D attempts to simulate the excitement of the game by incorporating many aspects of the actual sport. Fundamentally, curling is about force, mass, friction, momentum, rotation and collision. The app exploits the sophisticated physics engine built into the iPhone OS to generate a convincing simulation of all these elements as they interact. In the terminology of curling, the weight is the velocity of the stone; the turn is the rotation of the stone (which affects its trajectory); and the line is the direction of the throw or delivery. Curling3D allows the player to continuously and independently control all three, permitting advanced tactics such as the guard, takeout, and tap. In addition, the app allows the player to sweep the ice while their stone is moving, adjusting trajectory after the delivery.\r\n\r\nTry it… you won’t be disappointed.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGGZM7HV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"CotBot City","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15551.13510798883388823.da8cbc26-d4c7-4604-bc5c-dc399ecf4237.1eecd353-ec45-467c-a71a-7aeca48032a5","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#008a00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22288.13510798883388823.41be661d-905d-40df-a7b2-3a5a4a2739b4.4984f0e4-89d4-4e25-a3a2-4c495d077aab","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#008a00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56035.13510798883388823.c60983fa-62f2-4701-b397-f5adb8103d52.be62043b-cc7e-4400-83e9-4002dfeba3ef","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#008a00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23697.13510798883388823.1021a5a6-2a00-43e5-97e2-481d9900e28b.bd679e84-ef96-4efc-9730-63f6e2e91377","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#008a00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54105.13510798883388823.241d3982-4cf6-4a52-b2f0-2bcea0c37e7f.4747394d-2756-4f09-b65b-ccae59e6ad7f","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#008a00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17061.13510798883388823.bd13e1ab-c4af-4188-ab32-60e810e55b17.6d3b85ef-93f1-4605-8a6f-a26cba6127a3","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#008a00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£2.49","Price":2.49,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["DivineRobot.CotBotCity_2knm1cg03m4s8"],"ContentIds":["9cad40d6-4809-0bc9-acb7-b3fd91fa94f4","f5d70b81-bb29-056a-4499-1fc5ac2d9048"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"In CotBot City you can explore the city on a virtual car play mat.

Wield magic cards instead of weapons and slay the armies of darkness in the dungeons below the Old Cathedral. Save the terror-stricken Paperverse from the clutches of the Archdemon himself! \r\n\r\nCARDS AND DECKBUILDING\r\nIt’s not a card game, but items, spells, and skills are all expressed as cards. The strategy lies in adapting your hand to each situation. Cards can be upgraded with runes and you can find many variants with diverse bonuses. Legendaries are the most epic but hard to acquire.\r\n\r\nTAILORED SESSIONS WITH FLEXISCOPE\r\nBook of Demons respects your time. It features the Flexiscope engine which allows you to divide the game into sessions of any size. It even learns your pace of gaming and predicts the time to complete the next session.\r\n\r\nUNIQUE MECHANICS\r\nSimplified movement and fight mechanics is where Book of Demons differs the most from other hack & slash games. There is often not enough time to click-remove all of the obstacles such as monster shields, enemy spells, poison, or knocked cards, so timing, card selection and order of execution are critical.\r\n\r\nHACK & SLASH IN THE WORLD OF PAPERVERSE\r\nBook of Demons takes place in Paperverse, a world that exists entirely inside a pop-up book. It’s a tale of good and evil about saving the world from the ultimate devilry. Sounds familiar? Inspired by the dark and gloomy atmosphere of the first Diablo game, Book of Demons is part tribute part parody of hack & slash classics.\r\n\r\nCOMFORT OF GAMEPLAY\r\nMany Book of Demons features were designed with gameplay comfort in mind. Points of interest are marked at the top of the screen and get revealed once you get closer. Your character leaves footprints, which can be used to track your way back or notice paths already visited without opening the map.\r\n\r\nCHALLENGING ENDGAME\r\nOn average it takes about 10 hours to complete the campaign with a single class, but maxing out a character and mastering all of the higher Freeplay difficulty levels and Quests takes much longer. The Roguelike mode offers another level of challenge with permadeath, restricted healing and even more obstacles to overcome.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4V5DN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Marbel Supermarket","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6298.13510798887486791.eecc52c3-ac12-49b8-9cdb-d08c2bfbba64.abd8c4e3-ac9b-40ca-9021-a9e2bac8c322","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18630.13510798887486791.fdc3c120-1d0e-4943-8371-5f42d6ca6f5f.ee033d26-8a2d-4415-aa2d-083161bd2a6d","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30037.13510798887486791.f9b07ac5-516a-4529-abd5-d6ae06c8550f.0f769144-3fe2-4860-8bb4-fc1afa0635ea","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£1.69","Price":1.69,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["51290EducaStudio.MarbelSupermarket_r2jchfe82evvg"],"ContentIds":["68f73c35-3942-368f-2526-40830cccd70c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Marbel Supermarket!

You can chat and send commands just as if you are using the Minecraft client. Send commands just as you do while playing Minecraft (/r, /ban, /kick etc). - Supports Minecraft 1.7 and higher - No server limit - Tap and hold a player name for quick buttons like /kick, /ban, /mute etc - More features on the way! Notes: - MineChat does not work with servers that require client modification such as Tekkit. - MineChat will work over 3G/4G, but eats up a good bit of data and can run slow depending on your connection. So it is recommended you are on WI-fi when in using MineChat. - MineChat does not support Forge Modloader servers. - MineChat sends a spawn command automatically upon connection to help prevent your character from getting killed while using the app. However, not all servers support the spawn command or have delay before teleporting you which leaves your character vulnerable during that time period. Be sure you are aware how your server handles spawning. Security: MineChat does not send any credentials or information of any kind to any third party servers. The only information transmitted is directly to Minecraft servers. It uses the exact same login method as the Minecraft game uses. It transmits login credentials over SSL and uses encryption while transmitting game data. For additional information or issues when connecting, please contact us directly as we cannot respond to Windows Store reviews.\r\n\r\nMineChat does not support modded clients such as Forge and Tekkit.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4VRHB","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Doodle Mafia","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37527.13510798887508703.88fdb134-0f81-4afe-b9e0-defaf637f5a6.ea66a060-f097-4481-8ac4-921d8e2cad61","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16369.13510798887508703.5f68134d-dc67-4700-aa32-fd5dcaa168af.46c50e5e-7810-4841-a603-f56537975eb7","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60230.13510798887508703.53af4c91-8d3a-4edb-9b99-fbf3d538f8a5.b098ba1c-35ad-44a6-8b77-fce893880d2e","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£2.09⁺","Price":2.09,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["JoyBitsLtd.DoodleMafia_2687mb06qk6xe"],"ContentIds":["29e56d0c-965e-261f-9c63-636f6a473837"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Crime Does Pay!\r\n\r\nPlay as a Gangster or Cop.\r\nOver 500 Puzzles to Solve & Items to Create\r\n\r\nWATCH YOUR CRIME CITY COME ALIVE AS YOU PLAY!\r\n\r\nDoodle Mafia is the biggest “Doodle” game ever!

An assisted driving system allows everyone to learn even the most extreme stunts and thanks to the three play modes, anyone can experience the thrill of a real aerobatic pilot according to their abilities. Do you think you are really an expert? Compete with the simulation mode and push your reflexes to the maximum!\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL and SPECIAL MANEUVERS\r\nDiscover all the secrets of aerobatics with 3D briefing, take complete control and activate the aircraft with the right timing on the rudder, landing gear and smoke deployment! Take off, fly and run all opening maneuvers with the C-130 “Fat Albert”, either \"PARADE PASS\" or \"ASSAULT LANDING,\" with no limits, and you just have to give it your best. Now you can sit in the cockpit as a soloist and perform an \"AILERON ROLL\" to familiarize yourself with your own F/A-18 to then use all your adrenaline in increasingly challenging and complex maneuvers up to formation flying: the \"DIAMOND ROLL,\" \"DELTA BREAK-OUT,\" and \"FLEUR DE LIS\" are just a few examples of all the possible shapes that you will be called upon to perform by covering all roles of the true Blue Angels pilots.\r\n\r\nAIRSHOW\r\nPlan your exhibition by composing real aerobatics with faithfully reproduced official scenarios: NAF El Centro, NAS Key West, Reno, Elmendorf AFB and Baltimore. Your ultimate goal is to complete all airshows! You can do this by executing the real maneuvers in sequence or randomly. You have the freedom of choice. For every maneuver, you decide what role to play: the #1 FLIGHT LEADER, one of the wings, the #2 RIGHT WING and #3 LEFT WING, the #4 SLOT or one of the soloists, the #5 LEAD and #6 OPPOSING SOLO. \r\n\r\nADDITIVE MODE\r\nCreate aerobatic figures with additive mode! Freely position the planes in the scenario you've chosen and decide whether to make them take off. You can start with a standard flight or  high altitude and then take control of each aircraft in sequence. Aim nose up, make a loop, light the smoke, fly as you like, and when you're satisfied, the session for the first plane ends and the second aircraft takes off. Choose to fly in free formation or DIAMOND, DELTA, ECHELON, and LINE ABREAST and make spectacular combinations that you can relive with the use of multi-camera replays.\r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE AND SCORES\r\nOur trajectory detection system will tell you how accurate you are and the more precise you will be at all stages of the maneuver, the higher your score. Complete the figures to your best ability, exercise, win all medals and gain experience to rise to this level. This will give the you best scores and you will reach the top of the leaderboard!\r\n\r\nMAIN FEATURES:\r\n- F/A-18 fighter jets and C-130 “Fat Albert” transport aircraft\r\n- Innovative formation flying and assisted guidance system \r\n- All official Blue Angels maneuvers, playable in all roles\r\n- All configurations: takeoff, diamond, delta, echelon, line abreast and soloist\r\n\r\n- Use Airshow Mode to complete a real exhibition with a custom sequence of maneuvers\r\n- Additive Mode to create your aerobatic figure\r\n- Special missions: free flight, exploratory, pursuit and C-130 JATO\r\n\r\n- 3D Briefing display for easy understanding of the maneuver\r\n- Innovative help system with three difficulty levels to suit both beginners and more experienced pilots\r\n- Accurate trajectory measurement system for evaluation of the score\r\n\r\n- 3D virtual cockpit\r\n- Multi-camera replay system with dynamic views\r\n- 3D exploratory area to deepen knowledge of the aircraft","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH58K2Z","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Patchwork: The Game","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15723.13510798886911914.d2cae32a-ef71-4d7b-8d41-61be1efaeb7d.bda8125c-9de4-499e-ab2d-7bc124f07002","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52735.13510798886911914.9cb2ddca-922b-4c8e-b011-ae882079f3be.f41769f2-c296-4a0e-a376-664e8f85910b","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45113.13510798886911914.66feeb34-aa02-468c-b796-8a197ec6fd31.bcb5bc78-7b3b-458e-b527-407a702ad06f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£2.49⁺","Price":2.49,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["Digidiced.PatchworkTheGame_abh3vgaej6ys8"],"ContentIds":["eb89dd06-44cd-734d-dc24-c675f7d0fdc2","36d73e2e-d2f2-8b9b-8724-4f8ee3d5f045","41270030-29f6-b36d-baa3-361ba3ae7624","739e59e6-f285-28b5-ed03-708c222f875d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"\"Uwe Rosenberg’s Patchwork may not be quite as famous a board game as Monopoly or Cluedo, but on the evidence of its official mobile game, it’s very fun.\" - The Guardian \r\n\r\n\"... if you don't even give this game a chance, you are going to miss out on something great. \" - Altered Confusion\r\n\r\n\"A super fun easy to learn, yet strategic game\" ... \"a must-have for anyone who enjoys digital board games.\" appaddict\r\n\r\n\"...perfect for on-the-go play.\" - Pockettactics \r\n\r\n\"It’s perfect for long sessions with families, parties, road trips, offline and online quick play, you name it.\" - Pocketmeta \r\n\r\n\"Patchwork delivers a replayable experience that weaves a great theme with solid mechanics.\" - toucharcade\r\n\r\n\"Who knew making a patchwork quilt would be so cut throat.\" - Glitchfreegaming \r\n\r\n\"...[Ich kann] daher auf jeden Fall eine Empfehlung für diese tolle digitale Umsetzung des Brettspiels geben.\" - appgefahren\r\n\r\n\"The strategy can get complex in Patchwork The Game.\" - FamilyFriendlyGaming\r\n\r\n\"Patchwork: The Game pieces together the right elements for an enjoyable digital board game that is well worth picking up.\" Apple 'n' Apps \r\n\r\n\"Look, if you like Patchwork and have a mobile phone, get Patchwork The Game.\" - whatsericplaying\r\n\r\n\"Today another awesome board game that has been digitized for [us] mobile users. \" - appreviewcentral\r\n\r\n\"Quit what you’re doing and start QUILTING!\" - ungeek.ph\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this award-winning board game for two, quilting has never been more competitive!
